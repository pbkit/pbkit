// Note:
//   This compares pbkit with protobuf.js for the all necessary steps for codegen.
//   It's may not fair comparison because the two are different, but both commonly involve reading files, parsing, and transform into the internal representation.

// TBD: pbkit doesn't support loading from file descriptor yet
