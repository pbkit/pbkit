## What is Protobuf?

<https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>

> Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible
> mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster,
> and simpler.

## And what is Pbkit?

Pbkit is a collection of tools related to protobuf.

It is written in TypeScript and uses the Deno api.

However, it can be executed in any JavaScript environment (including Node.js or
web browser) because it does not use platform APIs inside the `core` directory.

## What features are provided?

### CLI

- `pb` - Protobuf schema compiler like `protoc`.
  - `protoc` has native binary dependencies, but `pb` command is written in pure
    TypeScript, so it can be used comfortably in Node.js projects, etc., and can
    even easily be run in a web browser.
  - [How to install and how to use](./cli/pb/README.md)
- `pollapo` - A package manager for the protobuf schema.
  - A GitHub repository of `.proto` files is treated as a single pollapo
    package.
  - [How to install and how to use](./cli/pollapo/docs/en/getting-started.md)

### Library
